# Keyword_Setting_Cipher

These two small programs allow a user to encode or decode a set of text using a keyword and setting.

I got the idea to write this after tooling around on the NSAs website and coming across their kids section.
Therein is a small introduction to ciphers with some challenges, the advanced challenge is about cracking a keyword-setting cipher.

The initial decode program was (and is) not intended to help one solve a cipher not meant for them but to rapidly decode a cipher that is.
The encrypt program, thusly, was written to compliment it and allow a user to rapidly encode plaintext to ciphertext.

This was, of course, for fun and learning only, certainly isn't optimized, and rough with formatting but you should be able to work out how to use it simply enough.
